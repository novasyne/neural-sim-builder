# Neural Simulator Builder

I'll help you build a biologically-plausible spiking neural network simulator in Python!

This skill guides you through creating neural simulators with **four progressive levels of complexity**, with all parameters validated against published neuroscience research.

## 🎯 What I Do

I help you build neural simulators at four sophistication levels:

### Level 1: Basic Neural Circuit ⚡
**Foundation**: Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with realistic biophysics
- Action potential generation with Na⁺, K⁺, and leak channels
- Absolute refractory period (5 ms, Berry & Meister 1998)
- Synaptic connections with propagation delays
- NaN guard and input current clamping for numerical stability
- Spike raster plots and voltage traces

### Level 2: Adaptive Learning Networks 🧠
**Adds**: Synaptic plasticity and pattern learning
- **STDP** (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity): LTP=0.15, LTD=0.06 per spike pair
  (Bi & Poo 1998; A+/A- ~2.5 for net potentiation)
- **STP** (Short-Term Plasticity): Facilitation and depression
- E:I weight ratio of 1:4 (Markram et al. 2015)

### Level 3: Bioenergetic Networks 🔋
**Adds**: Metabolic constraints, energy coupling, and homeostatic gain control
- ATP production from glucose and ketones (glycolysis + OXPHOS)
- Initial ATP: 3 mM (measured via ³¹P MRS; Zhu et al. 2012)
- **Michaelis-Menten glucose transport** via GLUT1 (Km=7 mM; Barros et al. 2005)
- **Glycogen shunt**: astrocytic energy buffer for burst activity (Dienel & Rothman 2019)
- **ATP→E_K coupling**: Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase impairment shifts K⁺ reversal (Attwell & Laughlin 2001)
- **ATP-gated AGC**: homeostatic firing-rate control that weakens under metabolic stress
  (Turrigiano & Nelson 2004)
- Mitochondrial Complex I dysfunction models

### Level 4: Structural Cortical Networks 🏗️
**Adds**: Realistic architecture and physical rewiring
- Layered organization (input → processing → integration)
- Diverse cell types (pyramidal cells, basket cells)
- Distance-dependent connectivity (Markram et al. 2015):
  feedforward 50%, local 30%, distant 5%
- **ATP-gated synaptogenesis**: new synapse formation limited by metabolic budget
  (GMR model; Rae et al. 2024)
- Spatiotemporal pattern learning

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Me Your Goal
Just describe what you want to explore:
- "I want to understand how neurons fire"
- "Show me how neural networks learn patterns"
- "Simulate the effect of low glucose on learning"
- "Build a cortical network that rewires itself"

### Step 2: I'll Recommend a Level
Based on your goal, I'll suggest the appropriate complexity level.

### Step 3: I Generate Complete Code
You'll receive a ready-to-run simulation with visualizations.

### Step 4: Run and Experiment
```bash
python simulate.py  # Run the simulation
```

### Step 5: Customize and Extend
I'll help you adjust parameters, add features, debug, or upgrade to the next level.
